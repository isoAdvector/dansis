# Win 15,000 dKr for your thesis!

If you have produced a thesis that is related to a topic within the fields of fluid mechanics, then you now have the opportunity of making money from it.
DANSIS would like to reward you for your efforts by offering you the chance to win the annual ‘Best Fluid Mechanics Thesis Award’. The prize is 15,000 Kr.

The award is given to a person or group of persons who, in an one year period up to 31st July, have submitted a completed thesis for review to a Danish institute of further education.
The work’s content must primarily be focused upon a topic within fluid mechanics or one closely related. It can be experimentally, theoretically or numerically based, or a combination.

The DANSIS committee will judge the received theses and contact the winner directly. A short presentation (max 10 mins) of the winning project will be expected to be given by the recipient at the October
DANSIS Seminar, where the prize will be presented.

## Requirements
- The student/s need to be enrolled in a Danish institute of further education
- The thesis must have been completed in a one year period up to 31st July
- The thesis must be sent into DANSIS by 1st August at the latest
- The thesis must have significant fluid mechanics content

## Enter the competition
Send your thesis by e-mail to dansis@dansis.dk as a PDF file or a link
