Christian Kringel and Victor Hvass Mølbak win this year's DANSIS graduate award for their thesis "Numerical Modelling of Air-Induced Drag Reduction for Marine Vessels with a Multifield Two-Fluid Model".

Again this year we had many very qualified contributions for the graduate award. The winners of 2024 did an extensive numerical study on a new type of two phase flow model to predict drag reduction under ship hulls using air lubrication.
We congratulate Christian Kringel and Victor Hvass Mølbak with the award and thank all the candidates who have sent in their thesis for consideration for the award.
